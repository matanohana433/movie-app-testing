ðŸ§ª Testing Categories


1. Functional Tests


    - Validate core application features, such as:
      - User signup and login.
      - Leaving comments on movies.
      - Logging out successfully.
2. Smoke Tests


    - Confirm critical workflows, such as:
      - Admin login.
      - Accessing the admin dashboard.
      - Managing users and comments.
3. Security Tests


    - Ensure application security by:
        - Preventing duplicate user creation.
        - Blocking unauthorized access to admin features.
        - Checking incorrect login attempts.
4. Acceptance Tests


    - Verify the application meets business requirements:
        - Adding new movies.
        - Ensuring data consistency across the dashboard and homepage.
ðŸ“Š Example HTML Report


    - The test execution generates an HTML report (report.html), which includes:
        - Test results summary (e.g., passed, failed).
        - Test execution duration.
        - Detailed logs for each test case.
ðŸŒŸ Key Features


Reusable Fixtures:

    conftest.py provides a global setup fixture for initializing WebDriver, selectors, and options.
Cross-Test Interaction:

    Tests validate changes across user actions, such as adding movies and checking updates on the admin dashboard.
Detailed Reporting:

    The HTML report (report.html) provides a clear view of test results, including success and failure logs.
ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

    Extend browser compatibility with Firefox and Edge WebDrivers.
    Integrate with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
    Enhance error handling for test failures.
    Add performance testing for application responsiveness.
